Let me break it down step by step for you:\n\n## Option 1: Running Locally with Python\n\n1. Navigate to the project directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/\n   ```\n\n2. Install the required dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n3. Run database migrations:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py makemigrations\n   python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\n4. Create a superuser (if you want to access the admin panel):\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py createsuperuser\n   ```\n   Or use the default admin/admin credentials that were set up\n\n5. Start the development server:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py runserver\n   ```\n\n6. Access the website at http://localhost:8000 and the admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin\n\n## Option 2: Running with Docker\n\n1. Navigate to the project directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/\n   ```\n\n2. Build and start the Docker containers:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose up --build\n   ```\n\n3. Access the website at http://localhost:8000 and the admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin\n\n4. To stop the containers, press Ctrl+C in the terminal or run:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose down\n   ```\n\n## Regarding folders (.storage, cover, logs)\n\nThese folders are typically used for:\n- `.storage`: Temporary storage for the application\n- `cover`: Code coverage reports\n- `logs`: Application logs\n\nYou don't necessarily need to have these folders locally if you're just running the project. They will be created automatically as needed by the application. If they're not referenced in the code, they might not be needed at all.\n\n## Do you need to run `cd workspace` first?\n\nYes, you need to be in the correct directory before running the commands. If the project is located in the workspace directory, you'll need to navigate there first using `cd workspace` or the full path `cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/` before running any of the commands listed above.\n\nWould you like me to explain any particular aspect of running the project in more detail?",

I can help explain how to run the Nike shoes e-commerce project both locally with Python and with Docker. Let me break it down step by step for you:\n\n## Option 1: Running Locally with Python\n\n1. Navigate to the project directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/\n   ```\n\n2. Install the required dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n3. Run database migrations:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py makemigrations\n   python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\n4. Create a superuser (if you want to access the admin panel):\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py createsuperuser\n   ```\n   Or use the default admin/admin credentials that were set up\n\n5. Start the development server:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py runserver\n   ```\n\n6. Access the website at http://localhost:8000 and the admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin\n\n## Option 2: Running with Docker\n\n1. Navigate to the project directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/\n   ```\n\n2. Build and start the Docker containers:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose up --build\n   ```\n\n3. Access the website at http://localhost:8000 and the admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin\n\n4. To stop the containers, press Ctrl+C in the terminal or run:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose down\n   ```\n\n## Regarding folders (.storage, cover, logs)\n\nThese folders are typically used for:\n- `.storage`: Temporary storage for the application\n- `cover`: Code coverage reports\n- `logs`: Application logs\n\nYou don't necessarily need to have these folders locally if you're just running the project. They will be created automatically as needed by the application. If they're not referenced in the code, they might not be needed at all.\n\n## Do you need to run `cd workspace` first?\n\nYes, you need to be in the correct directory before running the commands. If the project is located in the workspace directory, you'll need to navigate there first using `cd workspace` or the full path `cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/` before running any of the commands listed above.\n\nWould you like me to explain any particular aspect of running the project in more detail?",

Let me break it down step by step for you:\n\n## Option 1: Running Locally with Python\n\n1. Navigate to the project directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/\n   ```\n\n2. Install the required dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n3. Run database migrations:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py makemigrations\n   python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\n4. Create a superuser (if you want to access the admin panel):\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py createsuperuser\n   ```\n   Or use the default admin/admin credentials that were set up\n\n5. Start the development server:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py runserver\n   ```\n\n6. Access the website at http://localhost:8000 and the admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin\n\n## Option 2: Running with Docker\n\n1. Navigate to the project directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/\n   ```\n\n2. Build and start the Docker containers:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose up --build\n   ```\n\n3. Access the website at http://localhost:8000 and the admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin\n\n4. To stop the containers, press Ctrl+C in the terminal or run:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose down\n   ```\n\n## Regarding folders (.storage, cover, logs)\n\nThese folders are typically used for:\n- `.storage`: Temporary storage for the application\n- `cover`: Code coverage reports\n- `logs`: Application logs\n\nYou don't necessarily need to have these folders locally if you're just running the project. They will be created automatically as needed by the application. If they're not referenced in the code, they might not be needed at all.\n\n## Do you need to run `cd workspace` first?\n\nYes, you need to be in the correct directory before running the commands. If the project is located in the workspace directory, you'll need to navigate there first using `cd workspace` or the full path `cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/` before running any of the commands listed above.\n\nWould you like me to explain any particular aspect of running the project in more detail?",

Navigate to the project directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/\n   ```\n\n2. Build and start the Docker containers:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose up --build\n   ```\n\n3. Access the website at http://localhost:8000 and the admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin\n\n4. To stop the containers, press Ctrl+C in the terminal or run:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose down\n   ```\n\n## Regarding folders (.storage, cover, logs)\n\nThese folders are typically used for:\n- `.storage`: Temporary storage for the application\n- `cover`: Code coverage reports\n- `logs`: Application logs\n\nYou don't necessarily need to have these folders locally if you're just running the project. They will be created automatically as needed by the application. If they're not referenced in the code, they might not be needed at all.\n\n## Do you need to run `cd workspace` first?\n\nYes, you need to be in the correct directory before running the commands. If the project is located in the workspace directory, you'll need to navigate there first using `cd workspace` or the full path `cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/` before running any of the commands listed above.\n\nWould you like me to explain any particular aspect of running the project in more detail?",

Let me break it down step by step for you:\n\n## Option 1: Running Locally with Python\n\n1. Navigate to the project directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/\n   ```\n\n2. Install the required dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n3. Run database migrations:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py makemigrations\n   python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\n4. Create a superuser (if you want to access the admin panel):\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py createsuperuser\n   ```\n   Or use the default admin/admin credentials that were set up\n\n5. Start the development server:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py runserver\n   ```\n\n6. Access the website at http://localhost:8000 and the admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin\n\n## Option 2: Running with Docker\n\n1. Navigate to the project directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/\n   ```\n\n2. Build and start the Docker containers:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose up --build\n   ```\n\n3. Access the website at http://localhost:8000 and the admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin\n\n4. To stop the containers, press Ctrl+C in the terminal or run:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose down\n   ```\n\n## Regarding folders (.storage, cover, logs)\n\nThese folders are typically used for:\n- `.storage`: Temporary storage for the application\n- `cover`: Code coverage reports\n- `logs`: Application logs\n\nYou don't necessarily need to have these folders locally if you're just running the project. They will be created automatically as needed by the application. If they're not referenced in the code, they might not be needed at all.\n\n## Do you need to run `cd workspace` first?\n\nYes, you need to be in the correct directory before running the commands. If the project is located in the workspace directory, you'll need to navigate there first using `cd workspace` or the full path `cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/` before running any of the commands listed above.\n\nWould you like me to explain any particular aspect of running the project in more detail?",

Let me break it down step by step for you:\n\n## Option 1: Running Locally with Python\n\n1. Navigate to the project directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/\n   ```\n\n2. Install the required dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n3. Run database migrations:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py makemigrations\n   python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\n4. Create a superuser (if you want to access the admin panel):\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py createsuperuser\n   ```\n   Or use the default admin/admin credentials that were set up\n\n5. Start the development server:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py runserver\n   ```\n\n6. Access the website at http://localhost:8000 and the admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin\n\n## Option 2: Running with Docker\n\n1. Navigate to the project directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/\n   ```\n\n2. Build and start the Docker containers:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose up --build\n   ```\n\n3. Access the website at http://localhost:8000 and the admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin\n\n4. To stop the containers, press Ctrl+C in the terminal or run:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose down\n   ```\n\n## Regarding folders (.storage, cover, logs)\n\nThese folders are typically used for:\n- `.storage`: Temporary storage for the application\n- `cover`: Code coverage reports\n- `logs`: Application logs\n\nYou don't necessarily need to have these folders locally if you're just running the project. They will be created automatically as needed by the application. If they're not referenced in the code, they might not be needed at all.\n\n## Do you need to run `cd workspace` first?\n\nYes, you need to be in the correct directory before running the commands. If the project is located in the workspace directory, you'll need to navigate there first using `cd workspace` or the full path `cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/` before running any of the commands listed above.\n\nWould you like me to explain any particular aspect of running the project in more detail?",

Let me break it down step by step for you:\n\n## Option 1: Running Locally with Python\n\n1. Navigate to the project directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/\n   ```\n\n2. Install the required dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n3. Run database migrations:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py makemigrations\n   python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\n4. Create a superuser (if you want to access the admin panel):\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py createsuperuser\n   ```\n   Or use the default admin/admin credentials that were set up\n\n5. Start the development server:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py runserver\n   ```\n\n6. Access the website at http://localhost:8000 and the admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin\n\n## Option 2: Running with Docker\n\n1. Navigate to the project directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/\n   ```\n\n2. Build and start the Docker containers:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose up --build\n   ```\n\n3. Access the website at http://localhost:8000 and the admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin\n\n4. To stop the containers, press Ctrl+C in the terminal or run:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose down\n   ```\n\n## Regarding folders (.storage, cover, logs)\n\nThese folders are typically used for:\n- `.storage`: Temporary storage for the application\n- `cover`: Code coverage reports\n- `logs`: Application logs\n\nYou don't necessarily need to have these folders locally if you're just running the project. They will be created automatically as needed by the application. If they're not referenced in the code, they might not be needed at all.\n\n## Do you need to run `cd workspace` first?\n\nYes, you need to be in the correct directory before running the commands. If the project is located in the workspace directory, you'll need to navigate there first using `cd workspace` or the full path `cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/` before running any of the commands listed above.\n\nWould you like me to explain any particular aspect of running the project in more detail?",

I can help explain how to run the Nike shoes e-commerce project both locally with Python and with Docker. Let me break it down step by step for you:\n\n## Option 1: Running Locally with Python\n\n1. Navigate to the project directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/\n   ```\n\n2. Install the required dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n3. Run database migrations:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py makemigrations\n   python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\n4. Create a superuser (if you want to access the admin panel):\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py createsuperuser\n   ```\n   Or use the default admin/admin credentials that were set up\n\n5. Start the development server:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py runserver\n   ```\n\n6. Access the website at http://localhost:8000 and the admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin\n\n## Option 2: Running with Docker\n\n1. Navigate to the project directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/\n   ```\n\n2. Build and start the Docker containers:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose up --build\n   ```\n\n3. Access the website at http://localhost:8000 and the admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin\n\n4. To stop the containers, press Ctrl+C in the terminal or run:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose down\n   ```\n\n## Regarding folders (.storage, cover, logs)\n\nThese folders are typically used for:\n- `.storage`: Temporary storage for the application\n- `cover`: Code coverage reports\n- `logs`: Application logs\n\nYou don't necessarily need to have these folders locally if you're just running the project. They will be created automatically as needed by the application. If they're not referenced in the code, they might not be needed at all.\n\n## Do you need to run `cd workspace` first?\n\nYes, you need to be in the correct directory before running the commands. If the project is located in the workspace directory, you'll need to navigate there first using `cd workspace` or the full path `cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/` before running any of the commands listed above.\n\nWould you like me to explain any particular aspect of running the project in more detail?",

The template helps you get started, see the Template section for more information.\n0. Principles\n - Outline all features to develop based on the user requirements. If the requirements are not clear about the features, propose your own version, which, if completed, should fulfill the requirements precisely but not overly.\n - During your development, ensure NO omission NOR surplus of your listed features. NO MORE, NO LESS. This applies to the first development and all incremental requirements/emerging issues.\n - DON'T make improvements without user's consent. End current round of development IMMEDIATELY if you have completed all listed features.\n - If you encounter any issues related to the listed features, fix them directly. Your fix should take minimum steps. When you complete your fix, run `pmpn run lint` for a final check. If the check passes, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to ask the user to test on your fix outcome IMMEDIATELY. You should STOP fixing without user's feedback.\n - If you cannot solve the encountered issues with reasonable attempts, you should ask human immediately for help.\n1. Preparation\n - When provided a system design, read it first with Editor.read in a single response without any other commands. After reading, clearly indicate what files are instructed by the system design, then adhere to the design in your implementation. You may skip this step if no system design is provided.\n - Navigate to the template to start the project, using ```cd {template_path}```. This step is CRUCIAL.\n - For ANY development task (new project or incremental development) requiring user authentication or data storage, read the Backend section first (MANDATORY BEFORE ANY CODE IMPLEMENTATION OR MODIFICATION).\n2. Use Engineer2.write_new_code to create new code files or rewrite code files. Plan out all files and call write_new_code only once for all files. Make sure you include all files listed in the system design if given.\n3. Write out every code detail, DON'T leave TODO or PLACEHOLDER.\n4. Editor is used to edit a small part of a file. You may edit multiple files in one response, but each file is allowed ONLY one operation. DON'T include the row number in the code generated or in the string your want to replace, they are there just for you to understand the position.\n5. When using Editor.edit_file_by_replace, be mindful of white spaces and line breaks!\n6. After finishing the React/Vue project, run `pnpm i && pnpm run lint` to install dependencies and check for potential issues. Perform this operation every time you complete your development (i.e., for the first user requirment and every incremental requirement that follows). If you encounter any issues, fix them before proceeding.\n6.1. For the first time you complete the React/Vue project, use `pnpm run dev` to serve the project. Use this command ONLY ONCE as the service stays active in the background. DON'T serve the project again for incremental requirements.\n6.2. For incremental development, do not rebuild or run `pnpm run dev` after every code modification, as the updates are reflected automatically.\n7. Preview the project if you launch a service, using the `Terminal.preview` function. Use this command only after you have seen the actual port number. Again, if the service stays active and you have previewed it before, you don't need to run this command again.\n8. DON'T run or test non-React/Vue projects (such as Python, Java, or Go) yourself. Users should be responsible for running these projects on their own. This step is CRUCIAL for the project to be set up correctly.\n9. Use correct file paths, mind any cd command, for the current directory will change after executing the cd command and applies to all commands after it.\n10. Regarding personal card development: if no additional user information has been provided, you should directly deploy the retrieved template without any modifications.\n11. Check project structure and read necessary files when provided with a repo that you have no information for.\n12. When the developed project needs to obtain images, do not fetch them in advance.\n14. For data dashboard requirements, use the streamlit template. To ensure the project runs correctly, when the user provides data, first view a small portion of the data, and then design the data dashboard based on the data and user requirements.\n15. For Streamlit projects, you must enable the debug option during deployment to ensure the project runs correctly. Use `streamlit run your_script.py` to run the project and don't assign a port.\n16. For projects requiring user-provided data:\n - If Data Analyst has provided JSON/other files, first use Editor.read to understand the key-value structure, then copy to the public directory with appropriate subfolders (e.g., `public/data/some_data.json`). Use relative path in the code.

Let me break it down step by step for you:\n\n## Option 1: Running Locally with Python\n\n1. Navigate to the project directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/\n   ```\n\n2. Install the required dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n3. Run database migrations:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py makemigrations\n   python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\n4. Create a superuser (if you want to access the admin panel):\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py createsuperuser\n   ```\n   Or use the default admin/admin credentials that were set up\n\n5. Start the development server:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py runserver\n   ```\n\n6. Access the website at http://localhost:8000 and the admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin\n\n## Option 2: Running with Docker\n\n1. Navigate to the project directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/\n   ```\n\n2. Build and start the Docker containers:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose up --build\n   ```\n\n3. Access the website at http://localhost:8000 and the admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin\n\n4. To stop the containers, press Ctrl+C in the terminal or run:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose down\n   ```\n\n## Regarding folders (.storage, cover, logs)\n\nThese folders are typically used for:\n- `.storage`: Temporary storage for the application\n- `cover`: Code coverage reports\n- `logs`: Application logs\n\nYou don't necessarily need to have these folders locally if you're just running the project. They will be created automatically as needed by the application. If they're not referenced in the code, they might not be needed at all.\n\n## Do you need to run `cd workspace` first?\n\nYes, you need to be in the correct directory before running the commands. If the project is located in the workspace directory, you'll need to navigate there first using `cd workspace` or the full path `cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/` before running any of the commands listed above.\n\nWould you like me to explain any particular aspect of running the project in more detail?",

            "instruction": "\nBased on the context, write a plan or modify an existing plan to achieve the goal. A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don't forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\n\n6. Carefully consider how you handle web tasks:\n - Use SearchEnhancedQA for general information searching, i.e. querying search engines, such as googling news, weather, wiki, etc. Usually, no link is provided.\n - Use Browser for reading, navigating, or in-domain searching within a specific web, such as reading a blog, searching products from a given e-commerce web link, or interacting with a web app.\n - Use DataAnalyst.write_and_execute_code for web scraping, such as gathering batch data or info from a provided link.\n - Write code to view the HTML content rather than using the Browser tool.\n - Make sure the command_name are certainly in Available Commands when you use the Browser tool.\n7. When you are making plan. It is highly recommend to plan and append all the tasks in first response once time, except for 7.1.\n7.1. When the requirement is inquiring about a pdf, docx, md, or txt document, read the document first through either Editor.read WITHOUT a plan. After reading the document, use RoleZero.reply_to_human if the requirement can be answered straightaway, otherwise, make a plan if further calculation is needed.\n8. If the requirement explicitly mentions generating/creating/writing/producing a document/report/summary, you should use Editor.write to output the document.\n9. Don't finish_current_task multiple times for the same task.\n10. Finish current task timely, such as when the code is written and executed successfully.\n11. When using the command 'end', add the command 'finish_current_task' before it.\n12. When asked to convert user provided data for web display, convert them to JSON format based on user requirement, and store them ALL and totally. DO NOT use ellipsis (...) or only part of the data.\n13. If you have trouble processing docx or pdf documents, try use some tools (like python-docx, PyPDF2 etc.). Never generate data by yourself. For Word documents, carefully preserve all formatting elements including structure, styling, and embedded content, sophisticated design is needed.\n",

Let me break it down step by step for you:\n\n## Option 1: Running Locally with Python\n\n1. Navigate to the project directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/\n   ```\n\n2. Install the required dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n3. Run database migrations:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py makemigrations\n   python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\n4. Create a superuser (if you want to access the admin panel):\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py createsuperuser\n   ```\n   Or use the default admin/admin credentials that were set up\n\n5. Start the development server:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py runserver\n   ```\n\n6. Access the website at http://localhost:8000 and the admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin\n\n## Option 2: Running with Docker\n\n1. Navigate to the project directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/\n   ```\n\n2. Build and start the Docker containers:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose up --build\n   ```\n\n3. Access the website at http://localhost:8000 and the admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin\n\n4. To stop the containers, press Ctrl+C in the terminal or run:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose down\n   ```\n\n## Regarding folders (.storage, cover, logs)\n\nThese folders are typically used for:\n- `.storage`: Temporary storage for the application\n- `cover`: Code coverage reports\n- `logs`: Application logs\n\nYou don't necessarily need to have these folders locally if you're just running the project. They will be created automatically as needed by the application. If they're not referenced in the code, they might not be needed at all.\n\n## Do you need to run `cd workspace` first?\n\nYes, you need to be in the correct directory before running the commands. If the project is located in the workspace directory, you'll need to navigate there first using `cd workspace` or the full path `cd /data/chats/p60ai/workspace/` before running any of the commands listed above.\n\nWould you like me to explain any particular aspect of running the project in more detail?",
